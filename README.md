## ```Bazel``` syntax for ``Sublime Text 3``

This provides a `Bazel` syntax that can be used in ``Sublime Text 3``
It mostly follows the `Python` syntax with minor changes to support ``Bazel``-specific workflows

For example, currently, this it will highlight the absence of a comma at the
end of a list entry as a mistake.

This syntax also includes some useful Snippets.
