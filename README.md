# Bazel syntax for Sublime Text 3
This provides a `Bazel` syntax that can be used in Sublime Text 3. It mostly
follows the `Python` syntax with very minor changes to support bazel-specific
workflow.

For example, currently, this syntax will highlight the absence of a coma at the
end of a list entry as a mistake.

This syntax also includes some useful Snippets.
